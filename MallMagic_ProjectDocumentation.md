## Module Architecture

The Mall Magic system follows a modular architecture pattern, with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components
1. **Layout Components**:
   - **Dashboard**: Main container component with sidebar, header, and content area
   - **Sidebar**: Navigation component for accessing different modules
   - **Header**: Contains language switcher, user info, and notifications

2. **Page Components**:
   - Module-specific pages (Dashboard, Admin, Sales, etc.)
   - Each page encapsulates its own state and UI elements

3. **UI Components**:
   - **Reusable UI elements**: Buttons, cards, tables, forms
   - **Data Visualization**: Charts, statistics cards, trend indicators

4. **Form Components**:
   - Specialized form components for data entry
   - Form validation and submission handling

### Data Flow Architecture
- React Context provides application-wide state (e.g., language preference)
- Each module manages its own state using React hooks
- Data fetching and updates are managed with React Query
- Changes propagate through the component hierarchy following React's unidirectional data flow

## Code Implementation

### Key Implementation Examples

#### 1. Multilingual Support Implementation

The application implements language switching through React Context and component-level translations:

```typescript
// Translation object structure
const translations = {
  en: {
    welcome: "Welcome to Mall Magic",
    subtitle: "Here's an overview of your mall performance",
    // Other English translations
  },
  hi: {
    welcome: "मॉल मैजिक में आपका स्वागत है",
    subtitle: "यहां आपके मॉल के प्रदर्शन का अवलोकन है",
    // Other Hindi translations
  }
};

// Language toggle in Header component
const toggleLanguage = () => {
  setLanguage(language === 'en' ? 'hi' : 'en');
};

// Using translations in components
const DashboardPage: React.FC<DashboardPageProps> = ({ language }) => {
  const t = translations[language];
  
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6 animate-fade-in">
      <h1 className="font-bold text-3xl">{t.welcome}</h1>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground">{t.subtitle}</p>
      {/* Rest of component */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### 2. Purchase Management Implementation

The Purchase page implements CRUD operations for purchase orders with search, edit, and delete functionalities:

```typescript
// PurchasePage component excerpt
const PurchasePage: React.FC<PurchasePageProps> = ({ language }) => {
  const t = translations[language];
  const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
  const [isAddDialogOpen, setIsAddDialogOpen] = useState(false);
  const [isEditDialogOpen, setIsEditDialogOpen] = useState(false);
  const [selectedPurchase, setSelectedPurchase] = useState<Purchase | null>(null);

  const handleAddPurchase = () => {
    setIsAddDialogOpen(true);
  };
  
  const handleEditPurchase = (purchase: Purchase) => {
    setSelectedPurchase(purchase);
    setIsEditDialogOpen(true);
  };
  
  const handleDeletePurchase = (id: string) => {
    // In a real application, this would delete from the database
    toast.success(t.deleteSuccess);
  };
  
  const handleFormSuccess = () => {
    setIsAddDialogOpen(false);
    setIsEditDialogOpen(false);
    setSelectedPurchase(null);
  };

  const filteredData = purchaseData.filter(purchase => 
    purchase.vendor.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
    purchase.id.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
  );
  
  // Component rendering with search, table, and dialogs
}
```

#### 3. Navigation Implementation

The application uses React Router for navigation and a custom Sidebar component for the navigation menu:

```typescript
// Sidebar navigation setup
const navItems: NavItem[] = [
  {
    path: '/dashboard',
    label: { en: 'Dashboard', hi: 'डैशबोर्ड' },
    icon: LayoutDashboard
  },
  {
    path: '/admin',
    label: { en: 'Admin', hi: 'प्रशासन' },
    icon: Users
  },
  // More navigation items...
];

const Sidebar: React.FC<SidebarProps> = ({ isOpen, language }) => {
  return (
    <aside className={cn(/* styling */)}>
      <nav className="px-2 py-4">
        <ul className="space-y-1">
          {navItems.map((item) => (
            <li key={item.path}>
              <NavLink
                to={item.path}
                className={({ isActive }) => cn(/* styling based on active state */)}
              >
                <item.icon size={20} />
                {isOpen && <span>{item.label[language]}</span>}
              </NavLink>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </aside>
  );
};

// App routing setup
const App = () => {
  const [language, setLanguage] = useState<'en' | 'hi'>('en');
  
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Dashboard />}>
            <Route index element={<Index />} />
            <Route path="dashboard" element={<DashboardPage language={language} />} />
            <Route path="admin" element={<AdminPage language={language} />} />
            {/* Other routes */}
          </Route>
        </Routes>
      </BrowserRouter>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
};
```

#### 4. Data Visualization Implementation

The system uses Recharts for data visualization to display revenue trends and other analytics:

```typescript
// RevenueChart component simplified example
const RevenueChart = ({ language }: { language: 'en' | 'hi' }) => {
  const data = [
    { month: 'Jan', revenue: 1200000 },
    { month: 'Feb', revenue: 1900000 },
    // More data points...
  ];
  
  return (
    <div className="bg-card col-span-3 rounded-lg border p-6">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-4">
        {language === 'en' ? 'Revenue Over Time' : 'समय के साथ राजस्व'}
      </h3>
      <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={350}>
        <AreaChart data={data}>
          <defs>
            <linearGradient id="colorRevenue" x1="0" y1="0" x2="0" y2="1">
              <stop offset="5%" stopColor="#8884d8" stopOpacity={0.8}/>
              <stop offset="95%" stopColor="#8884d8" stopOpacity={0}/>
            </linearGradient>
          </defs>
          <XAxis dataKey="month" />
          <YAxis tickFormatter={(value) => `₹${value / 100000}L`} />
          <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
          <Tooltip formatter={(value) => `₹${value}`} />
          <Area 
            type="monotone" 
            dataKey="revenue" 
            stroke="#8884d8" 
            fillOpacity={1} 
            fill="url(#colorRevenue)" 
          />
        </AreaChart>
      </ResponsiveContainer>
    </div>
  );
};
```

   - Primary color: Indian Purple (#9b87f5) - Represents luxury and prosperity
   - Secondary colors: Indian Green (#2E7D32), Indian Red (#FF5252) - For status indicators
   - Neutral grays for backgrounds and text
   - High-contrast elements for better readability

2. **Typography**:
   - Sans-serif fonts for clean, modern appearance
   - Hierarchical text sizes for clear information architecture
   - Support for both Latin and Devanagari scripts

3. **Layout**:
   - Responsive grid system adapting to different screen sizes
   - Dashboard layout with sidebar navigation and content area
   - Card-based UI for grouping related information

   - Shadcn/UI components for consistent design language
   - Custom cards for statistics and data representation
   - Tables with sorting and filtering capabilities
   - Forms with validation and instant feedback
   - Modal dialogs for focused tasks

### Responsiveness
The application is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes from desktop monitors to mobile devices:

1. **Desktop View**: Full layout with expanded sidebar, detailed charts, and data tables
2. **Tablet View**: Collapsible sidebar, slightly compressed visualizations
3. **Mobile View**: Hidden sidebar (toggle-accessible), stacked cards, simplified tables

### User Experience Considerations
1. **Navigation**: Intuitive sidebar navigation with icons and labels
2. **Feedback**: Toast notifications for user actions and system events
3. **Forms**: Inline validation, clear error messages, logical tab order
4. **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts with tooltips and context information
5. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast

### Cultural Adaptations
